		<h1><b>Test Fest:</b> 5-in-1 Usability Testing</h1>
		<div class="project">
		<div class="decorated"><span><h2>Overview</h2></span></div>
			<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>The idea for this study was borrowed from a <a href="http://library.harvard.edu/03172016-0929/student-test-fest" target="_blank">study</a> conducted at the Harvard User Research Center. The test consisted of five 20-minute usability tests, with five participants who rotated through each of the tests over a 2-hour period.</p>
			<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>Test Fest was about more than trying something new. The undertaking required our team to work together and provided an opportunity to work with others curious about UX. The format also allowed our team to conduct usability tests 5 distinct pieces of the (massive) UNC Libraries website simultaneously.</p>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
				<p>Why did we select this experimental design?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Saves time: Conduct 5 tests at once!</li>
						<li>Saves money: One larger incentive over many small ones.</li>
						<li>Backlog of testing: Lots of things to test? Try it.</li>
						<li>Experiment: Try a new methodology.</li>
						<li>Involve more people: Spread the word about usability.</li>
					</ul>
		<div class="decorated"><span><h2>Logistics</h2></span></div>
			<h3>Recruitment</h3>
			<div class="pic-right"><img src="testfest_flyer.jpg" alt="Test Fest Flyer" style="margin-top:0;"></div>
				<p>Due to the long format of the test, we used a variety of techniques to ensure our recruitment goal would be met:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Email to contacts collected from a previous usability survey</li>
					<li>Flyers posted around campus with links to sign up</li>
					<li>Heavy incentive ($40 gift card in exchange for a 2-hour session)</li>
					<li>Free snacks and drinks on testing day (helps with fatigue!)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Overall, our efforts were very successful, with 80 total respondents!</p>
			<h3>People</h3>
				<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Staff: </span>2 fulltime staff and 6 grad students divided across 5 tests (4 moderated and one automated) including one time-keeper</p>
				<p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.2em;">Participants: </span>10 UNC Chapel Hill undergraduate students (5 for each day of testing)</p>
				</div> 
			<h3>Setup</h3>
				<p>Location was the largest hurdle. We needed a big space with lots of little spaces inside. In the end, we opted to rent out a suite of empty study carrels in the University library.</p>
				<div class="columns" style="margin-left: 1em;">
					<h4>Pros:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Small, private rooms</li>
							<li>Quiet environment</li>
							<li>Less preparation time needed</li>
						</ul>
					<h4>Cons:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Difficult for participants to find</li>
							<li>Rooms a bit <i>too</i> small</li>
							<li>Sunlight made some rooms uncomfortably warm</li>
						</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Other preparations included borrowing laptops, moving furniture, stocking refreshments, and creating signage such as room labels and directional signs.</p>
				<p>Take a look at the final setup:</p>

			<h3>Schedule of Events</h3>
				<p><b>Pre-Fest:</b> welcome, name tags, consent, paperwork</p>
				<p><b>Hour One:</b> participants are run through their first 3 tests, rotating every 20 minutes</p>
				<p><b>Hour Two:</b> break for snacks, followed by the remaining 2 tests (again, 20 minutes each)</p>
				<p><b>Post-Fest:</b> general debrief of participants</p>
			<h3>Pilot Test</h3>
				<p>With so many moving parts, we opted to run a full 2-hour pilot test the week before the study. Five grad students with an interest in UX were recruited as stand-in “participants,” and offered free donuts and experience. We tested the schedule of events as well as each of the tests, making changes as needed before the true testing would begin.</p>
		<div class="decorated"><span><h2>Test #4: The Sketch Test</h2></span></div>
			<h3>My Role</h3>
				<p>Each of us in the Usability Department had the opportunity to design and moderate one of the usability tests. For my test (#4), I evaluated the homepage of the UNC Libraries website using a method deemed the "Sketch Test."</p>
			<h3>The Test</h3>
				<p>The Sketch Test required participants to create sketches of their ideal webpage design. Participants were alloted five minutes for each drawing, and asked to think aloud as they worked on their sketches. The test consisted of three individual tasks:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>"Design your ideal library website homepage from scratch."</li>
					<li>"Please annotate this image of UNC's current library homepage, making any changes you see fit."</li>
					<li>"Thinking about the previous tasks, design a new library website hompage for UNC."</li>
				</ol>
			<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>You can learn a lot about design from people who don't know what they're doing. Even more important than the actual sketches produced were the stories my participants told as they created them.</p>

			<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
				<p>In addition to compiling individual usability reports from the results of each test, we wanted to look at the big picture. Because the tests shared a common theme (i.e., the UNC Libraries website), we thought it would be interesting to dump all of our findings into one large pool and look for patterns. After typing up our notes, we met a week later to create an affinity diagram from the results. This was later coded into a spreadsheet for easy reference.</p>

		<div class="decorated"><span><h2>Lessons Learned</h2></span></div>
			<h3>Don't:</h3>
				<ul>
				<li><h4>Schedule your test the morning after a big game.</h4>
					<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">February 9, 2017:</span> UNC plays Duke in basketball (and loses).</p>
					<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">February 10, 2017:</span> We lose 2 of our 5 participants.</p></li>
				<h4><li style="text-transform: none;">Collect more data than you can reasonably analyze.</li></h4>
					<p>After two full days of test-festing and five completed usability tests, we were left with A LOT of data to analyze. It took us two 3-hour lunch meetings just to organize one giant affinity diagram!</p>
				</ul>
			<h3>Do:</h3>
				<ul>
				<h4><li style="text-transform: none;">Be flexible.</li></h4>
					<p>Despite the no-shows, our efforts would not go to waste! We ran the test according to plan. Later, we set up a third mini test session, running just those tests which required more participants.</p>
				<h4><li style="text-transform: none;">Try new things!</li></h4>
					<p>The team learned a lot from experimenting with this new method. It was both fun and an efficient use of time. It also allowed us to include outsiders and educate them about the usability testing process while gathering insight from a variety of perspectives.</p>
				</ul>
